# WCS Tutorial Project

This interactive tutorial project was designed to get you started with Wix Component Studio (WCS). Each component within the project contains a fun lesson that teaches the basic concepts of WCS.

The project includes SCSS support for writing nested rules, style variables, imports, and more. Feel free to clone the project and take WCS for a test drive.
